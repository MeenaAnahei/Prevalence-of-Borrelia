# Dataset Summary

The *Borrelia burgdorferi* outer surface protein dataset is a molecular ecology dataset that consists of DNA sequences and other metadata for four outer surface proteins A,B,C, and p35 (BBA64).This data is derived from *Ixodes pacificus* ticks and their vertebrate hosts collected in the Bay Area of California.This dataset helps support research on how the genetic diversity of outer surface proteins correlates with vector and host diversity which provides insights into the transmission dynamics of *Borrelia* in the western United States.

# Data Instances

Each data point represents a tick or host with DNA sequence data for at least one or two outer surface proteins along with metadata about the collection and identification.

# Rationale

This data set was curated to explore the genetic variation of outer surface proteins that are crucial for the survival and transmission of *Borrelia.* OspA and B are expressed in the tick mid gut while C and p35 are expressed in the hosts. Understanding the variation across tick and hosts species provides insights into the ecology of Lyme Disease.

# Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Samples were collected during tick season of April-May 2018-2024 in the Bay Area of California.Ticks were collected from vegetation and ear punches were taken from hosts then stored in ethanol. DNA was then extracted and gene specific PCR was performed to confirm the presence of outer surface proteins. 

# Annotation Process 

PCR results were interpreted from gel electrophoresis banding patterns. Positive bands were recorded verifying the tick and host IDs.

# WHo are the Annotators

Original collectors, identifiers, and DNA extractors were undergraduate and graduate researchers from San Francisco State University. For PCR and electrophoresis, graduate researchers.

# Personal and Sensitive Information

This dataset contains the names of the collectors, identifiers, and those who conducted every wet lab experiment.

# Social Impact of Dataset

This enhances the understanding of *Borrelia burgdorferi* distribution and outer surface protein expression in the western US. This region of the US has been less understood in terms of Lyme disease ecology. With this dataset, it can further inform public health efforts in vector surveillance and control. 

# Discussion of Biases

Sampling was limited to ticks collected at specific sites in the Bay Area of California. Some sites had more collections than others due to abundance and weather at the time of tick and mammal collection. Host diversity may be biased by the trapping success.PCR detection may depend on DNA quality and primer performance. 

# Other Known Limitations

Mixed infections can possibly be under detected due to the PCR protocol being used that takes into account one species of *Borrelia*. There is temporal variation not taken into account from the samples collected across all 7 years. There is a possibility of cross contamination and the risk of false positives as PCRs are sensitive especially if they're not controlled.
